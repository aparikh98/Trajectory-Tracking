# Trajectory Tracking 
The overall goal of this lab was to determine our own trajectories for path planning and then use various controllers in order to allow Baxter to follow those paths. In this lab, we calculate 4 types of trajectories: a linear path that is a straight line to a goal, a circle around a target, a combination of linear paths and an AR tracking. We implement controllers in the joint space and workspace including PD velocity, torque and impedance controllers, and compare the performance to Baxterâ€™s built in functions for path planning and control in its MoveIt Package.
You can find a video of Baxter utilizing our controllers and our path planning on Youtube.
